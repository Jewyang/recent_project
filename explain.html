                The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known
                periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded
                from an initial state of extremely high density and temperature 13.8 billion years ago.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                According to the Big Bang theory, space itself has been expanding ever since, carrying galaxies with
                it. The earliest stages of this expansion are described by the theory of cosmic inflation, which
                explains the universe's large-scale homogeneity and isotropy.

                String theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are
                replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings propagate through space and interact
                with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary
                particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the
                string.

              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                String theory has the potential to be the first complete "theory of everything", unifying all the
                fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak
                nuclear force.

                The multiverse is a hypothetical group of multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise
                everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, the physical laws and the
                constants that describe them. The different universes within the multiverse are called "parallel
                universes", "other universes", or "alternative universes".

                The multiverse concept has been hypothesized in cosmology, physics, astronomy, religion, and
                philosophy. It has a variety of different types and philosophical implications, depending on the
                specific proposed model of the multiverse.

                A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even particles and
                electromagnetic radiation such as light, can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts
                that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.

              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Black holes are among the most intriguing and mysterious objects in the universe. They are thought to
                be the endpoints of the lives of massive stars, formed when a star's core collapses in on itself.
                Black holes can also form from the merger of two neutron stars or from other exotic processes.

                Dark matter is a form of matter thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe
                and about a quarter of its total energy density. Its presence is implied in a variety of astrophysical
                observations, including gravitational effects that cannot be explained by accepted theories of gravity
                unless more matter is present than can be seen.

              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Dark matter is called "dark" because it does not appear to interact with the electromagnetic field,
                meaning it does not absorb, reflect or emit electromagnetic radiation, and is thus difficult to detect.
